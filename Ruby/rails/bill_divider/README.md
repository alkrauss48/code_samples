<h1>Bill Divider</h1>

This app is meant to provide basic bill breakdowns for a party of people
and their respective bills.

MySQL is the database language, and the table structure is such that a:

* <b>Member</b> has many <b>Breakdowns</b>
* <b>Bill</b> has many <b>Breakdowns</b>

Google pie charts are also used to better present a graphical
representation for a bill's breakdown, as well as showing a total
payment comparison among all members.
